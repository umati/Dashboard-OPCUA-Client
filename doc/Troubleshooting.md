# Troubleshooting

## Missing DLLs (only Windows binary)

In case DLLs are missing, those are most likely from the Visual C++ Redistributable package. Those can be downloaded [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

## Using the Gateway with Firewall and TLS Inspection

### Introduction

This documentation describes how to use the gateway in an environment with a firewall and TLS Inspection. TLS Inspection, also known as SSL Inspection, is a security mechanism that allows the firewall to inspect the content of encrypted traffic. During TLS Inspection, the firewall exchanges the certificates to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt the traffic before forwarding it to its final destination.
Therefore, the CA certificates of the firewall must be stored to ensure that the firewall can correctly inspect and forward the traffic.

### Steps to Follow

#### Check if TLS Inspection is Present

First, you should check if TLS Inspection is present. Normally, when you access a TLS page (<https://>) in your Corporate Browser, you should not see the certificate of the page, but that of your firewall with TLS Inspection.

#### Obtain the CA Certificates

If TLS Inspection is present, you need to obtain the CA certificates of the firewall. You can visit e.g. <https://umati.app> and then simply download the certificate in the browser. In Firefox, it's under *address bar â†’ ðŸ”’ â†’ Connection secure â†’ More information â†’ View certificate â†’ Miscellaneous â†’ Download PEM (chain)*.

#### Add the CA Certificates to the `cacert.pem` File or as a Separate File

After you have obtained the CA certificates, you have two options:

- Place the CA certificate separately in a directory as a `.pem` or `.crt` file and explicitly specify the directory in `CaCertPath` in the configuration.
- Add the certificate as a text block to the `cacert.pem` file (overriding the CA) and add its path to `CaTrustStorePath`.

#### Adjust the Configuration

If you have placed the certificate separately as a `.pem` or `.crt` file in a directory, you need to adjust the configuration to specify the path to the CA certificate file. Add one of the corresponding fields to the [Configuration](Configuration.md):

```jsonc
  "Mqtt": {
    "CaCertPath": "/path/to/certs/",
    "CaTrustStorePath": "/path/to/cacert.pem"
    ...
```

Please note that these fields should only be set if explicitly advised.

When running in a container, use the `/app/` directory in the configuration, e.g.

```json
"CaTrustStorePath": "/app/cacert.pem"
```

and mount the certificate on startup:

`docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/configuration.json:/app/configuration.json -v /path/to/cacert.pem:/app/cacert.pem --name=dashboard-opcua-client ghcr.io/umati/dashboard-opcua-client`

### Conclusion

After these steps have been carried out, the gateway should be able to be used successfully in an environment with a firewall and TLS Inspection. If you have further questions or concerns, please contact the responsible support.
